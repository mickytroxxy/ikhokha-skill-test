This is a Front-End Software Engineer Task done in reactjs and material design.

I have attached the screenshots of both desktop and mobile version showing the responsiveness of the app. I redesined the app exactly as it is and had to change some backgrounds to make it look a lil fancy.

To test the app on your machine make sure you have nodejs, npm installed.
Download the zip file and extract it. 
Open cmd and navigate to the extracted folder, run npm install --save.
After the installation is success, run npm start to start the project.
The project usually runs on port:3000 unless it is in use.
